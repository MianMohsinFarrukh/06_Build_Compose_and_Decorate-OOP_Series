# 15. Method Resolution Order (MRO) and Diamond Inheritance
# Assignment:
# Create four classes:

# A with a method show(),

# B and C that inherit from A and override show(),

# D that inherits from both B and C.

# Create an object of D and call show() to observe MRO.



class A:
    def show(self):
        print("Show method from class A")

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("Show method from class B")

class C(A):
    def show(self):
        print("Show method from class C")

class D(B, C):
    pass  # D inherits from both B and C



d = D()
d.show()


print("\nMethod Resolution Order (MRO):")
print(D.mro())
